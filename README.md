# dpm

**Deno Package Manager**. Obviously fake.

Set up aliases on your system (Linux and macOS) to fool people just like I did:

```
alias dpm-init='deno run --allow-read --allow-write https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anuragbhd/dpm/master/dpm-init.ts'

alias dpm-install='deno run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anuragbhd/dpm/master/dpm-install.ts'
```

Then on, use the commands `dpm-init` and `dpm-install <package name>` to do your thing.
